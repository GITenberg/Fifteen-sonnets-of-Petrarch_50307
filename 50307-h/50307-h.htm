<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Near</span> my summer home there is a little cove or landing by the bay,
where nothing larger than a boat can ever anchor. I sit above it
now, upon the steep bank, knee-deep in buttercups, and amid grass so
lush and green that it seems to ripple and flow instead of waving.
Below lies a tiny beach, strewn with a few bits of driftwood and some
purple shells, and so sheltered by projecting walls that its wavelets
plash but lightly. A little farther out the sea breaks more roughly
over submerged rocks, and the waves lift themselves, before breaking,
in an indescribable way, as if each gave a glimpse through a
translucent window, beyond which all ocean&#8217;s depths might be clearly
seen, could one but hit the proper angle of vision. On the right side
of my retreat a high wall limits the view, while close upon the left
the crumbling parapet of Fort Greene stands out into the foreground,
its verdant scarp so relieved against the blue water that each inward
bound schooner seems to sail into a cave of grass. In the middle
distance is a white lighthouse, and beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">-vi-</a></span> lie the round tower of
old Fort Louis, and the soft low walls of Conanicut.</p>

<p>Behind me an oriole chirrups in triumph amid the birch-trees which
wave around the house of the haunted window; before me a kingfisher
pauses and waits, and a darting blackbird shows the scarlet on his
wings. Sloops and schooners constantly come and go, careening in the
wind, their white sails taking, if remote enough, a vague blue mantle
from the delicate air. Sailboats glide in the distance,&mdash;each a mere
white wing of canvas,&mdash;or coming nearer, and glancing suddenly into
the cove, are put as suddenly on the other tack, and almost in an
instant seem far away. There is to-day such a live sparkle on the
water, such a luminous freshness on the grass, that it seems, as is
often the case in early June, as if all history were a dream, and the
whole earth were but the creation of a summer&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>If Petrarch still knows and feels the consummate beauty of these
earthly things, it may seem to him some repayment for the sorrows of
a lifetime that one reader, after all this lapse of years, should
choose his sonnets to match this grass, these blossoms, and the
soft lapse of these blue waves. Yet any longer or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">-vii-</a></span> continuous
poem would be out of place to-day. I fancy that this narrow cove
prescribes the proper limits of a sonnet; and when I count the lines
of ripple within yonder projecting wall, there proves to be room for
just fourteen. Nature meets our whims with such little fitnesses.
The words which build these delicate structures of Petrarch&#8217;s are as
soft and fine and close-textured as the sands upon this tiny beach,
and their monotone, if such it be, is the monotone of the neighboring
ocean. Is it not possible, by bringing such a book into the open air,
to separate it from the grimness of commentators, and bring it back
to life and light and Italy? The beautiful earth is the same as when
this poetry and passion were new; there is the same sunlight, the
same blue water and green grass; yonder pleasure-boat might bear, for
aught we know, the friends and lovers of five centuries ago; Petrarch
and Laura might be there, with Boccaccio and Fiammetta as comrades,
and with Chaucer as their stranger guest. It bears, at any rate, if I
know its voyagers, eyes as lustrous, voices as sweet. With the world
thus young, beauty eternal, fancy free, why should these delicious
Italian pages exist but to be tortured into grammatical examples?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">-viii-</a></span>
Is there no reward to be imagined for a delightful book that can
match Browning&#8217;s fantastic burial of a tedious one? When it has
sufficiently basked in sunshine, and been cooled in pure salt air,
when it has bathed in heaped clover, and been scented, page by page,
with melilot, cannot its beauty once more blossom, and its buried
loves revive?</p>

<p>Emboldened by such influences, at least let me translate a sonnet
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_2">Lieti fiori e felici</a></span>), and see if anything is left after the sweet
Italian syllables are gone. Before this continent was discovered,
before English literature existed, when Chaucer was a child these
words were written. Yet they are to-day as fresh and perfect as these
laburnum blossoms that droop above my head. And as the variable and
uncertain air comes freighted with clover-scent from yonder field, so
floats through these long centuries a breath of fragrance, the memory
of Laura.</p>

<p>Goethe compared translators to carriers, who convey good wine to
market, though it gets unaccountably watered by the way. The more
one praises a poem, the more absurd becomes one&#8217;s position, perhaps,
in trying to translate it. If it is so admirable,&mdash;is the natural
inquiry,&mdash;why not let it alone? It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">-ix-</a></span> a doubtful blessing to
the human race, that the instinct of translation still prevails,
stronger than reason; and after one has once yielded to it, then
each untranslated favorite is like the trees round a backwoodsman&#8217;s
clearing, each of which stands, a silent defiance, until he has cut
it down. Let us try the axe again. This is to Laura singing
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_4">Quando Amor</a></span>).</p>

<p>As I look across the bay, there is seen resting over all the hills,
and even upon every distant sail, an enchanted veil of palest blue,
that seems woven out of the very souls of happy days,&mdash;a bridal veil,
with which the sunshine weds this soft landscape in summer. Such
and so indescribable is the atmospheric film that hangs over these
poems of Petrarch&#8217;s; there is a delicate haze about the words, that
vanishes when you touch them, and reappears as you recede. How it
clings, for instance, round this sonnet (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_6">Aura che quelle chiome</a></span>)!</p>

<p>Consider also the pure and reverential tenderness of one like this
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_8">Qual donna attende</a></span>). A companion sonnet, on the other hand
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_10">O passi sparsi</a></span>), seems rather to be of the Shakespearean type; the
successive phrases set sail, one by one, like a yacht squadron; each
spreads its graceful wings and glides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">-x-</a></span> away. It is hard to handle
this white canvas without soiling. Macgregor, in the only version of
this sonnet which I have seen, abandons all attempt at rhyme; but to
follow the strict order of the original in this respect is a part
of the pleasant problem which one cannot bear to forgo. And there
seems a kind of deity who presides over this union of languages, and
who sometimes silently lays the words in order, after all one&#8217;s poor
attempts have failed.</p>

<p>Yonder flies a kingfisher, and pauses, fluttering like a butterfly
in the air, then dives toward a fish, and, failing, perches on the
projecting wall. Doves from neighboring dove-cots alight on the
parapet of the fort, fearless of the quiet cattle who find there a
breezy pasture. These doves, in taking flight, do not rise from the
ground at once, but, edging themselves closer to the brink, with a
caution almost ludicrous in such airy things, thrust
themselves upon the breeze with a shy little hop, and
at the next moment are securely on the wing.</p>

<p>How the abundant sunlight inundates everything! The great clumps of
grass and clover are imbedded in it to the roots; it flows in among
their stalks, like water; the lilac-bushes bask in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">-xi-</a></span> eagerly; the
topmost leaves of the birches are burnished. A vessel sails by with
plash and roar, and all the white spray along her side is sparkling
with sunlight. Yet there is sorrow in the world, and it reached
Petrarch even before Laura died,&mdash;when it reached her. One exquisite
sonnet (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_12">I&#8217; vidi in terra</a></span>) shows this to have been true.</p>

<p>These sonnets are in Petrarch&#8217;s earlier manner; but the death of
Laura brought a change. Look at yonder schooner coming down the bay
straight toward us; she is hauled close to the wind, her jib is
white in the sunlight, her larger sails are touched with the same
snowy lustre, and all the swelling canvas is rounded into such lines
of beauty as scarcely anything else in the world&mdash;hardly even the
perfect outlines of the human form&mdash;can give. Now she comes up into
the wind, and goes about with a strong flapping of her sails, smiting
on the ear at a half-mile&#8217;s distance; then she glides off on the
other tack, showing the shadowed side of her sails, until she reaches
the distant zone of haze. So change the sonnets after Laura&#8217;s death,
growing shadowy as they recede, until the very last
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_14">Gli occhi di ch&#8217;io parlai</a></span>)
seems to merge itself in the blue distance.</p>

<hr class="med" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">-xii-</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;And yet I live!&#8221; (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ed io pur vivo</span>) What a pause is implied before
these words with which the closing sestet of this sonnet begins! the
drawing of a long breathy immeasurably long; like that vast interval
of heart-beats which precedes Shakespeare&#8217;s &#8216;Since Cleopatra died.&#8217;
I can think of no other passage in literature that has in it the
same wide spaces of emotion. Another sonnet
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_16">Soleasi nel mio cor</a></span>)
which is still more retrospective, seems to me the most stately and
concentrated in the whole volume. It is the sublimity of a despair
not to be relieved by utterance. In a later strain
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_18">Levommi il mio pensier</a></span>)
he rises to that dream which is more than earth&#8217;s realities.</p>

<p>It vindicates the emphatic reality and personality of Petrarch&#8217;s
love, after all, that when from these heights of vision he surveys
and resurveys his life&#8217;s long dream, it becomes to him more and
more definite, as well as more poetic, and is farther and farther
from a merely vague sentimentalism. In his later sonnets, Laura
grows more distinctly individual to us; her traits show themselves
as more characteristic, her temperament more intelligible, her
precise influence upon Petrarch clearer. What delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">-xiii-</a></span> accuracy of
delineation is seen, for instance, in the sonnet
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_20">Dolci durezze</a></span>)! In
the sonnet (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_22">Gli angeli eletti</a></span>) visions multiply upon visions. Would
that one could transfer into English the delicious way in which the
sweet Italian rhymes recur and surround and seem to embrace each
other, and are woven and unwoven and interwoven, like the heavenly
hosts that gathered around Laura.</p>

<p>Petrarch&#8217;s odes and sonnets are but parts of one symphony, leading
us through a passion strengthened by years and only purified by
death, until at last the graceful lay becomes an anthem and a &#8216;<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc
dimittis</span>.&#8217; In the closing sonnets Petrarch withdraws from the world,
and they seem like voices from a cloister, growing more and more
solemn till the door is closed. This is one of the last
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><a href="#Page_24">Dicemi spesso</a></span>).
How true is its concluding line! Who can wonder that women
prize beauty, and are intoxicated by their own fascinations, when
these fragile gifts are yet strong enough to outlast all the memories
of statesmanship and war? Next to the immortality of genius is that
which genius may confer upon the object of its love. Laura, while
she lived, was simply one of a hundred or a thousand beautiful and
gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">-xiv-</a></span> Italian women; she had her loves and aversions, joys and
griefs; she cared dutifully for her household, and embroidered the
veil which Petrarch loved; her memory appeared as fleeting and
unsubstantial as that of woven tissue. After five centuries we find
that no armor of that iron age was so enduring. The kings whom she
honored, the popes whom she revered are dust, and their memory is
dust, but literature is still fragrant with her name. An impression
which has endured so long is ineffaceable; it is an earthly
immortality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time is the chariot of all ages to carry men away, and beauty cannot
bribe this charioteer.&#8221; Thus wrote Petrarch in his Latin essays; but
his love had wealth that proved resistless, and for Laura the chariot
stayed.</p>

<p><i>Transcriber&#8217;s Note:</i> Below is a list of printer errors that have been
corrected in the Italian sonnets, by reference to the 1964 critical edition
of <i>Il Canzoniere</i> edited by Gianfranco Contini, available at
<a href="http://www.liberliber.it/online/autori/autori-p/francesco-petrarca/canzoniere-rerum-vulgarium-fragmenta/">Liber Liber</a>.
The translator of this book probably used
as his source an edition in which spelling and punctuation were
somewhat modernized; these modernizations have not been altered in
this e-book. Spacing of elisions (such as &#8220;ch&#8217;ascolti&#8221;) has been
normalized. The original book was printed almost entirely in italics,
which are not marked as such in this e-text. Printer errors in the
English introduction have been corrected without note.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
